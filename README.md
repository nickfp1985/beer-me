### Project Idea
We are going to build an app that users can search breweries near them, or by name, and then display information about the brewery. Phone numbers, addresses, possible beer recommendations.


We are building an app where users can search for cocktails and get information on that cocktail including the ingredients, the type of glass and how to make the drink.
