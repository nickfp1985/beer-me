### APIs
1.  BeerMapping - https://beermapping.com/api/ (the default return type for API queries is xml. If you want json returned instead, simply add &s=json to the end of any of these queries.)
2.  Google Maps?  Yelp? (yelp api request site was down at this time)

### Project Idea
We are going to build an app that users can search breweries near them, or by name, and then display information about the brewery. Phone numbers, addresses, possible beer recommendations.
